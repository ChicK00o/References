Entitas is an ECS framework for Unity 3D. 
    ECS came up recently in a discussion with Joseph Cooper. On further researching the topic, arrived at quite some ECS implementation for ECS. From all these implementations
    - Entitas
    - Ash Framework
    - Artemis C# port
    - Svelto-ECS

Most implementations are coupled to Unity DLL, hence would not be easily deployed to server. Entitas and Artemis are capable in this sense.

The important reason to choose Entitas is that its geared towards development on Unity3D. An active development by the original developers, as they are currently suing the same, as well as continuos optimizations for Unity3D for themselves as well as others

Suice contains data related to concepts of 
    IOC - Inversion of control and DI - Dependency Injection 
    This is built on using Suice framework for Unity3D by Joseph Cooper
    The example referenced in the data is the Unity Suice example in the other repository
