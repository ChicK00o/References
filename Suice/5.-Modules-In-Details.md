###Modules

There are 2 facility provided by the module concept

1)Overridable function *_"Configure()"_*
- This is used for creating different binding at compile time using compile time directives or even at Runtime using conditional statements.
- This can be used for say, Different Userprofile for different platform like -Android - Google Play service binding, IOS - Game-center service binding, to our defined bridge class and its interface. This would ensure better portability and manageable code
- example
    
```c#  
    public class UserProfileExampleModule : AbstractModule
    {
        public override void Configure()
        {
        #if UNITY_IOS
            Bind<IUserProfile>().To<iOSGameCenterBridge>().In(Scope.SINGLETON);
        #elif UNITY_ANDROID
            Bind<IPlatformExample>().To<AndroidGooglePlayBridge>().In(Scope.SINGLETON);
        #else
            Bind<IPlatformExample>().To<BackendBridge>().In(Scope.SINGLETON);
        #endif
        }
    }
```
- This is used for binding singletons and instances to specific implementations

2) Method Attribute *[Provide]*
- This method attribute is only available in a module
- It is used for binding factory methods to specific implementations
- Scope can be mentioned in attribute as 
    - *[Provide(Scope.SINGLETON)]*
        - Only one instance will be created and the same instance will be injected as dependency to all requesting types
    - *[Provide(Scope.NO_SCOPE)]*
        - New instance will be created for all types requiring dependency
- //TODO : Rohit :: ***more details to add and use cases
- //TODO : Rohit :: example

Things to keep in mind
- Configure and Binding of Provide only happens on Registering Module instance with the Injector
- First Configure is called, binding mentioned in it are created and then Bindings for Provide are created
