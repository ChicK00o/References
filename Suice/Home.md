Example project of using Suice Dependency Injection in Unity 4.6+

Suice – The Ultimate C# Dependency Injection Framework

The Suice project is an open-source project with the goal of creating an efficient Just In Time (JIT) dependency injection framework with the same awesome features Google’s Guice. Suice provides a strong depdency injection framework which will aid you in creating great test driven APIs. Destroying design patterns such as the singleton and replacing the ‘new’ keyword with [Inject] and factories will aid you in creating clean testable code.
