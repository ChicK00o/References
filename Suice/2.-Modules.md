Modules are classes that define factories, singletons and instances to specific implementations. For instance, if you want to specify that the INetworkService will be bound to the NetworkService implementation as a singleton instance type, you would do the following.
```c#
using CmnTools.Suice; 
public class ExampleModule : AbstractModule
{
    public override void Configure() 
    {
        Bind<INetworkService>().To<NetworkService>().In(Scope.SINGLETON);
    }
}
```

There are two scope types:

* Scope.SINGLETON
* Scope.NO_SCOPE 

If you define a scope as NO_SCOPE, which is by default for all bindings, it will create a new instance for every request of the dependency type. Modules also allow you to implement the factory pattern through methods. The following example shows how to create a new connection using the factory pattern which requires the dependency ISocket. 
For e.g. 
```c#
[Provides(Scope.NO_SCOPE)] 
public IConnection ProvideNewNetworkConnection(ISocket socket) 
{ 
    IConnection connection = new Connection(socket); 
    connection.Connect(); 
    return connection; 
}
```
 
Modules are great for defining conditional runtime or compile-time implementations for different platforms. Although, the easiest way to create a dependency is using Just In Time (JIT) attributes. JIT attributes are flags on classes and interfaces that can be defined to automatically create dependencies through reflection. There are several JIT attributes.
