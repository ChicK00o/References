Suice Injection has been completely written in c#, and does not reference anything Dependant on Unity3D. You could use it into another project of your choice too [C# project]. To demonstrate the same, Suice is included as DLL in to the plug-in folder for usage with the project. To look at the internal magic, checkout the project from [Suice GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Disturbing/suice)

Start the "ExampleScene" in SuiceExample/Scenes

It contains the 
Injector GameObject - SuiceExampleInjector component

This being derived from the MonoBehaviour is the entry point into the example. Unity KicksOff the Injector, where in _"Start()"_ we set up the Injector

* Register Modules
    - Common Modules
        + From the abstract the base class, these are the modules which will be part of all the project that we would ever create
    - Specific Modules
        + Overriding _RegisterModules()_ into the injector implementations. These Modules will be specific to the current working project

    [For More Details](https://github.com/ChicK00o/UnitySuice/wiki/5.-Modules-In-Details)
* Setup Event listeners

    All Event system registry function are added to a Injector delegate which is called after instantiating any object [specifically with _"OnInitializeDependancy"_]. This ensure to register all the events automatically on creation. Remember all object get registered with all the event systems that will be present
    - Unity Event Dispatcher 
        + This will be used for implementing MonoBehaviour functionality like _Update()_ into our general c# classes
    - Global Event Dispatcher
        + This is the global event bus for sending events across the whole system

* Initialize the Suice Injector
    For injector Initialization, Assembly needs to passed to it. We at the very least send in the current assembly, but say we create other pluggable app across where we would like to use the injector, we would send in the other assemblies in the initialization for the injector to work properly


On Running the example scene for some time the logs pushed are

```
TaskExample initialized!

Running platform specific task for DefaultPlatformExample!

Unity Start Event Called!

Executing standard delay message after 5 seconds!

Task Manager Example Ends in 3

Task Manager Example Ends in 2

Task Manager Example Ends in 1

```


1) _TaskExample initialized!_ log

Well lets explain how did all this get started - 
Class TaskExample InHerits from *_IInitializable_*, thus its _"Initialize()"_gets called when its Instance is created by the injector

Next obvious question is how, who and why was the instance created as there is no _"new"_ anywhere for creating it

The magic happened because of the *[Singleton]* attribute decorated at the top of the class
- When Injector gets initialized, all classes marked [Singleton] attribute gets initialized
- When creating instance injector follow :
    + Before reaching the point to create instances, the injector has gone-over the complete assembly and created a map for all dependencies for all types it is gonna handle
    + Create Instance by Providing Dependencies in Constructor
    + Provide Dependencies in Fields - we use this in-case of circular dependency situations
    + _Initialize()_ is called if the interface _IInitializable_ is inherited
        * This is where the log got printed
    + Events and Listeners are registered if any

2) _Running platform specific task for DefaultPlatformExample!_ log

- During Injector Initialization PlatformTaskServiceExample got registered as [Singleton] and its _OnStart()_ got registered with UnityEventDispatcher
- During Initiation of the Project, is when the UnityEventDispacther got created and attached to the Injector GameObject, so only its _Awake()_ has been executed by Unity
- It being the same continuous execution sequence, its _Start()_ is called only after completion of the Injector Initialization
- As per the UnityEventDispatcher, when its _Start()_ is called its Broadcasts, unity start event, which the PlatformTaskServiceExample is listening to in *_"OnStart()"_* by mentioning the type of Event its listens to in its Argument and having the _[EventListner]_ method attribute to it
- platformExample dependency of PlatformTaskServiceExample was injected as DefaultPlatformExample by Injector, which in turn was called in the _"OnStart()"_

3) _Unity Start Event Called!_ log

- Follows the above explained execution order, for UnityEventExample
- Yes there is currently no way to set the execution order, its one of the TODO feature list

4) _Executing standard delay message after 5 seconds!_ log & _Task Manager Example Ends in 3_ log & _Task Manager Example Ends in 2_ log & _Task Manager Example Ends in 1_ log

- Example of using a simple delayed task - mimicking Coroutine & Invoke idea, but handled and controlled at one location and easy to keep track
- Removing added task is TODO Feature
